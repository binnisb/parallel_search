MPI Single read
Here we have the single root process reading the file and distributing the work on all processes. The same calculations as in #MPI# are used to figure out how many bytes to send to each process.  After reading the file, the root process broadcasts basic information about how many bytes are in the file and how long each line is to all processes. Then we use MPI_Scatterv to distribute the workload to all processes. We hope that we can reduce the reading time compared to the #MPI# method while keeping linear speed-up on the searching part.
